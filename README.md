# ResearchTools — Manual

Reference for the skills, agents and commands shipped in this repository. Everything
documented here lives under `.claude/` in **this** repo (academic research tooling for
LaTeX writing, Scopus reference validation, paper/thesis auditing, and grant-template
conversion). For a map of how the pieces relate, see [Architecture.md](Architecture.md).

The repo ships **5 skills**, **11 agents**, and **17 commands**.

---

## Installation

Follow these steps on any machine after cloning the repository.

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Required for |
|---|---|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code) | Running agents and slash commands |
| [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (includes Git Bash) | Hooks that use `bash` shell |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) | Caveman-mode hooks (`caveman-activate.js`, etc.) |
| Python 3.x | Scopus skill scripts + security hooks (`betterleaks`, `pip-audit`, `prompt-injection-defender`) |
| `pip install requests google-genai openai` | Scopus skill + Gemini/Copilot cross-review |
| `pip install pymupdf4llm pymupdf` *(optional, AGPL-3.0)* | `extract-statistic` skill PDF parsing (`mine` mode), LLM-ready Markdown + table extraction; reuses `SCOPUS_API_KEY` via `download_pdf.py`, needs no key of its own |
| `pandoc` | `word2latex` skill (Word → LaTeX) |
| Obsidian Desktop *(optional)* | Obsidian vault integration in `CLAUDE.md` |

### Step 1 — Clone the repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/LARi-UQAC/ResearchTools.git
cd ResearchTools
```

### Step 2 — Generate machine-local configuration

Run the setup script from the repository root. It auto-detects Git Bash and Node.js,
asks for your Obsidian vault path (optional), and generates two gitignored files:
`.claude/settings.json` and `CLAUDE.md`.

```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

Verify that no `{{placeholder}}` remains after the script completes — it reports any
unreplaced values in the validation step.

### Step 3 — Make agents available globally (optional, recommended)

This step creates directory junctions from `~/.claude/agents/`, `~/.claude/skills/`,
`~/.claude/rules/`, and `~/.claude/commands/` into this repository, so that Claude Code
loads these agents and skills in **every** workspace, not only when you open this folder.

All links are directory junctions — no Administrator privileges required. Only missing
junctions are created; existing ones are never overwritten.

```powershell
# Preview what will be created without making changes
.\setup.ps1 -InstallJunctions -Preview

# Apply
.\setup.ps1 -InstallJunctions
```

> **Alternative (direct):** `.\install-junctions.ps1` (or `.\install-junctions.ps1 -WhatIf` to preview).

**How linking works by directory type:**

| Directory | Link type | One link per… | New file/folder after `git pull` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agents/` | Junction per sub-folder | Agent (e.g. `scopus-researcher/`) | Re-run `.\setup.ps1 -InstallJunctions` — existing agents show `[EXISTS]`, only the new one is created |
| `skills/` | Junction per sub-folder | Skill (e.g. `scopus/`) | Same as above |
| `rules/` | Junction on the whole directory | Entire `rules/` folder | Automatic — new `.md` files are visible immediately through the existing junction, no re-run needed |
| `commands/` | Junction on the whole directory | Entire `commands/` folder | Same as above |

Re-running `.\setup.ps1 -InstallJunctions` is therefore only needed when a **new agent or
skill sub-directory** is added to the repository. For new rules or commands files, the
existing junctions already expose them.

**Fallback when `rules/` or `commands/` already exists as a real directory** (another
project previously created it): the script automatically switches to per-file symbolic
links for any missing files. If Administrator privileges are required for the symlinks,
the script re-launches itself elevated.

Because the links point directly into this repository, a `git pull` is all that is
needed to propagate rule and command improvements contributed by any collaborator.

### Contributing improvements

Fork the repository, improve an agent or skill on a feature branch, and open a
pull request against `main`. The repository owner reviews and merges; a `git pull`
on their machine immediately updates the linked entries via the junctions.

## Environment variables / API keys

Set these at the Windows **User** scope (PowerShell), then restart Claude Code:

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('SCOPUS_API_KEY', 'your-key', 'User')
```

| Variable / source | Required for | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `SCOPUS_API_KEY` | **Required** — all `/scopus`, `/auditreview`, `/auditpaper`, `/auditthesis`, `/litreview`, `/bibclean`, `/replyreviewer`, and PDF retrieval | [Elsevier Developer Portal](https://dev.elsevier.com/) |
| `.scopus_key` file | Fallback for `SCOPUS_API_KEY` — place the key in `.claude/skills/scopus/.scopus_key` (gitignored) | same key as above |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | *Optional* — Gemini 2.0 Flash cross-review and table enrichment (deliberation panel) | [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | *Optional* — GPT-4o cross-review via GitHub Models (deliberation panel) | GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access token |
| `S2_API_KEY` *(or `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY`)* | *Optional* — Semantic Scholar author/PDF backfill; without it the throttled public pool is used | [Semantic Scholar API key request](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api) |
| `--insttoken` *(CLI flag, not an env var)* | *Optional* — off-campus Elsevier access when not on the UQAC network/VPN | UQAC library / Elsevier institutional token |

> An on-campus network connection or active UQAC VPN is required for Scopus access
> unless an `--insttoken` is supplied. Secrets are kept out of git: `.env`, `secrets/`,
> and `credentials/` are listed in `.gitignore`.

## Token Management

Use these tools together to keep sessions fast and cheap.

### Output modes

| Mode | Command | Max length | Formatting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Normal | *(none)* | Unlimited | Full — headers, tables, bullets |
| Concise | `/concis` | 5 sentences | Structured bullets allowed |
| Slim | `/slim` | 2 sentences | Code blocks only, no prose |

### Recommended workflow

1. **Start** every session with `/slim` (quick tasks) or `/concis` (exploratory work)
2. **Scope** context with `/focus <topic>` to avoid loading irrelevant files
3. **Monitor** with `/ctx` when responses feel slow — it reports context pressure in under 10 lines
4. **Compress** with `/compact` when `/ctx` reports moderate or high pressure

> `/compact` is destructive — conversation history is summarized and cannot be restored. Always run `/ctx` first to confirm it is needed.

### Quick reference

| Command | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| `/slim` | Fast edits, one-liners, quick questions |
| `/concis` | Code reviews, multi-step explanations |
| `/focus <topic>` | Long sessions touching many files |
| `/ctx` | When the session feels sluggish or heavy |
| `/compact` | After `/ctx` reports moderate/high pressure |

## Skills

Skills bundle scripts and references the agents reuse. Five ship in this repo.

| Skill | Purpose | Entry point |
|---|---|---|
| `scopus` | Search Scopus, validate references, fetch PDFs via the Elsevier REST API (with a Semantic Scholar fallback). | `/scopus`, `.claude/skills/scopus/SKILL.md` |
| `scientific-writing` | Core writing skill: scientific manuscripts in flowing IMRAD prose with verified citations (IEEE/APA/AMA/Vancouver) and reporting guidelines (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA). | `.claude/skills/scientific-writing/SKILL.md` |
| `scholar-evaluation` | ScholarEval framework — scores research work across problem formulation, literature review, methodology, data, analysis, results, writing, citations. | `.claude/skills/scholar-evaluation/SKILL.md` |
| `deliberation` | Two-round Gemini ↔ GitHub Copilot debate over a near-final draft; Claude arbitrates and validates any new references against Scopus. Used inside the auditor/researcher agents. | `.claude/skills/deliberation/SKILL.md` |
| `extract-statistic` | Statistical analysis. Mode `audit`: review a manuscript's own statistics (test selection, assumptions, effect size, presentation, cross-validation). Mode `mine`: extract the reported statistics of a corpus's full-text PDFs and synthesize a corpus statistics table plus an improvement-opportunity list. Engineering-default domain profiles. Used inside `paper-auditor` / `thesis-auditor` (audit) and `scopus-researcher` (mine). | `.claude/skills/extract-statistic/SKILL.md` |
| `word2latex` | Convert a Word `.docx` template (Mitacs, CRSNG, FRQNT, UQAC, partner forms) into a faithful LaTeX source. Delegates the patch work to the `word-to-latex` agent. | `/word2latex`, `.claude/skills/word2latex/SKILL.md` |

### `/scopus` — Scopus academic search

Searches the Scopus database via the Elsevier REST API. Requires `SCOPUS_API_KEY`
(see the API-keys table above) and an active institutional network connection
(campus or VPN), or an `--insttoken`.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/scopus <topic>` | Search top papers on a topic |
| `/scopus review <topic>` | Structured literature review with inline citations |
| `/scopus validate <DOI or title>` | Confirm a reference exists and return full metadata |
| `/scopus cite <DOI>` | Citation count + full metadata for one paper |
| `/scopus author <name>` | Author h-index and top publications |
| `/scopus journal <name or ISSN>` | Journal SJR quartile, CiteScore, subject areas |

**Files:**
- `.claude/skills/scopus/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/scopus/scripts/scopus_api.py` — Scopus REST client
- `.claude/skills/scopus/scripts/semantic_scholar_api.py` — Semantic Scholar fallback
- `.claude/skills/scopus/scripts/download_pdf.py` — full-text PDF retrieval
- `.claude/skills/scopus/scripts/gemini_reviewer.py` · `github_reviewer.py` · `gemini_table.py` — cross-review cores

---

### `/concis` — Concise mode

Activates for the rest of the session: max 5 sentences for short answers, structured
bullets for long answers, no preamble, no trailing summary, code written directly with
WHY-only comments. Responds in French unless the active file is in English.

**File:** `.claude/commands/concis.md`

### `/focus <topic>` — Session scope

Restricts the session to a single topic; everything outside it is ignored. Responds in
French unless the active file is in English.

**File:** `.claude/commands/focus.md`

### `/ctx` — Context window audit

Reports, in under 10 lines: estimated exchange turns, top 3 context-consuming topics/files,
a low/moderate/high pressure level, and a `/compact` recommendation when needed. Reads no
additional files. Responds in French.

**File:** `.claude/commands/ctx.md`

### `/tikz` — TiKZ validation

Validates TiKZ code (from `$ARGUMENTS` or the IDE file) against 6 rules:

| Rule | What is checked |
|---|---|
| Line breaks in nodes | `align=center` only — never `text centered` |
| backgrounds + scaling | No `\begin{scope}[on background layer]` inside `\resizebox`/`\scalebox` |
| Arrow angles | Arrows connect perpendicularly to node borders (.north/.south/.east/.west) |
| Overlaps | Min 3-character gap between rectangles; arrow labels must not overlap geometry |
| Anchoring | `positioning` library + `node distance` only — no absolute coordinates |
| TiKZiT compatibility | Named styles in `.tikzstyles`; no exotic libraries |

For each violation: cites the line, explains the cause, provides corrected code directly.

**File:** `.claude/commands/tikz.md`

### `/test [module]` — Run project tests

Reads `.claude/rules/testing.md`, selects the correct venv, runs the tests, and reports
**passed / total** with short error messages and likely causes.

**File:** `.claude/commands/test.md`

### `/doc <target>` — Documentation generator

Generates documentation following `.claude/rules/code-style.md` (Python Stage-N module +
Purpose/Inputs/Outputs docstrings; C# `/// <summary>`; LaTeX/Markdown equation formatting).
Documents WHY, not WHAT. Responds in French unless the active file is in English.

**File:** `.claude/commands/doc.md`

### `/latex` — LaTeX diagnosis and fix

Reads `out/*.log` first for exact error lines, cites the line, explains the cause, and
applies the fix directly. Priority checks: `\resizebox` wrapping a `backgrounds`-library
tikzpicture, `\\` in a `text centered` node, `\addcontentsline` order. States whether a
two-pass recompilation is needed. Responds in French.

**File:** `.claude/commands/latex.md`

### `/ref <citation>` — Academic reference formatter

Formats and validates references per UQAC / LAR.i rules.

**Accepted publishers:** IEEE, Springer, Elsevier, Taylor & Francis, Cambridge, Wiley, IET,
IOP, ACM, MDPI, ASME, ACME, BioMed Central (BMC). Any other publisher requires professor approval. Provides: full LaTeX
reference, clickable DOI via `\href`, a 0–100 % confidence level with justification, and an
introductory sentence. Never fabricates a reference or DOI.

**File:** `.claude/commands/ref.md`

### `/replyreviewer` — Peer reviewer response generator

Generates a formal LaTeX response letter per reviewer comment file and applies track-change
markup directly in the paper using the `changes` package. The reviewer ID (`id=RN`) in each
`\added`, `\replaced`, or `\deleted` command is the permanent, visible link between the paper
modification and the response letter. Delegates to the `reviewer-response` agent.

**Full command syntax:**

```
/replyreviewer --paper <paper.tex> --reviewers <r1.txt> [r2.txt ...] [--title "Title"] [--editor "Name"]
```

Example:
```
/replyreviewer --paper sn-article.tex --reviewers .\reviewers\R1.txt .\reviewers\R2.txt --editor "Zhouping Yin"
```

| Argument | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--paper <path.tex>` | Yes | Path to the original LaTeX paper |
| `--reviewers <files>` | Yes | One `.txt` file per reviewer; first = R1, second = R2, etc. |
| `--title "..."` | No | Paper title for the letter header; extracted from `\title{}` if omitted |
| `--editor "..."` | No | Editor name for the salutation; defaults to `[EDITOR NAME]` if omitted |

**What the agent produces:**

1. **One LaTeX response letter per reviewer** — `<basename>_response_R<N>.tex`, each with a
   formal opening, General Comments, point-by-point Specific Comments, and a Scopus-validated
   References Added section with clickable DOIs.
2. **Annotated original paper** — `\added[id=RN]{}` / `\replaced[id=RN]{}{}` / `\deleted[id=RN]{}`
   markup, grammar-only fixes applied directly, and `\usepackage{changes}` with one
   `\definechangesauthor` per reviewer (R1 blue, R2 red, R3 orange, R4+ purple) added to the
   preamble automatically.

**Comment categories processed:**

| Code | Category | Paper change |
|---|---|---|
| G | Grammar / spelling | Direct fix, no markup |
| S | Style / writing | `\replaced[id=RN]{new}{old}` |
| SC | Scientific issue | `\added[id=RN]{...}` |
| M | Methodology addition | `\added[id=RN]{...}` |
| R | Results addition | `\added[id=RN]{...}` |
| D | Discussion addition | `\added[id=RN]{...}` |
| FT | Figure / table issue | `\added[id=RN]{...}` new float |
| EQ | Equation issue | `\replaced[id=RN]{}{}` or `\deleted[id=RN]{}` |
| REF | Reference suggestion | Scopus-validated, `\added[id=RN]{\cite{}}` |
| Q | General quality | `\added[id=RN]{...}` |
| MAJ | Major revision | `\replaced[id=RN]{}{}` / `\deleted[id=RN]{}` |

**Prerequisites:** `SCOPUS_API_KEY` set; campus network or VPN active.

**Related commands:** `/auditpaper` (full audit before/after revision), `/bibclean`
(clean the `.bib` after adding references), `/ref` (format individual references).

**File:** `.claude/commands/replyreviewer.md`

## Agents

Agents are specialists Claude delegates to automatically based on context, or explicitly on
request ("use the `scopus-auditor` agent to…"). Eleven ship in this repo; most back a slash
command.

| Agent | Purpose | Command / trigger | Path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scopus-researcher` | Autonomous literature review: search, validate, summarize, PRISMA + gap/coverage/Pareto matrices, hypotheses, LaTeX output | `/litreview` | `.claude/agents/scopus-researcher/AGENT.md` |
| `scopus-auditor` | Audit an existing review; validate every reference; executable improvement plan | `/auditreview` | `.claude/agents/scopus-auditor/AGENT.md` |
| `paper-auditor` | Full paper content audit (intro→future works) + Scopus validation + ScholarEval score + improvement plan | `/auditpaper` | `.claude/agents/paper-auditor/AGENT.md` |
| `thesis-auditor` | Full UQAC thesis audit (front matter, hypothesis flow, chapter structure, bilingual consistency, UQAC compliance) + ScholarEval score | `/auditthesis` | `.claude/agents/thesis-auditor/AGENT.md` |
| `thesis-proposal-auditor` | Audit a UQAC thesis **proposal** (≤35 pages body, testable hypotheses, suggested methodology, no full results) + ScholarEval score | thesis-proposal audit / by name | `.claude/agents/thesis-proposal-auditor/AGENT.md` |
| `reviewer-response` | Point-by-point response letters + traceable `changes`-package markup in the paper | `/replyreviewer` | `.claude/agents/reviewer-response/AGENT.md` |
| `bib-cleaner` | Validate, deduplicate, normalize and DOI-enrich a `.bib` file | `/bibclean` | `.claude/agents/bib-cleaner/AGENT.md` |
| `submit-checker` | Pass/fail submission checklist against a target journal's requirements | `/submitcheck` | `.claude/agents/submit-checker/AGENT.md` |
| `word-to-latex` | Faithful Word `.docx` → LaTeX conversion (pandoc + visual-fidelity patches) | `/word2latex` | `.claude/agents/word-to-latex/AGENT.md` |
| `cover-paper` | Submission package: hidden Cover Letter in source, standalone Title Page PDF, Corresponding Author Profile PDF (recent papers from Scopus) | by name (at submission) | `.claude/agents/cover-paper/AGENT.md` |
| `latex-writer` | Bilingual LaTeX authoring: papers (IEEE/Springer/Elsevier), Beamer slides, TiKZ diagrams, thesis | by context (writing) | `.claude/agents/latex-writer/AGENT.md` |

The four ScholarEval auditors (`scopus-auditor`, `paper-auditor`, `thesis-auditor`,
`thesis-proposal-auditor`) score the document before writing the plan; after the plan is
executed they re-run the scoring on the revised source and report a before/after ScholarEval
comparison (baseline vs post), hard-gated so execution only completes when the score improves.

### `latex-writer` key rules

- TiKZ: relative positioning only; arrows perpendicular; no overlaps
- References: peer-reviewed only (IEEE, Springer, Elsevier, Taylor & Francis, Cambridge, Wiley, IET, IOP, ACM, MDPI, ASME, ACME, BioMed Central (BMC)); DOI via hyperref; any other publisher needs user confirmation
- Tables: rows = parameters, cols = concepts; bold headers; 10 % grey row shading
- Language: French default for UQAC thesis, English for scientific papers
- Avoid AI-detectable patterns: zero-width spaces, smart quotes, em dashes, perfect parallel lists

### `reviewer-response` key rules

- Reviewer files assigned sequentially: first file = R1, second = R2, etc.
- Grammar-only fixes (G): applied directly, no markup
- Additions `\added[id=RN]{}`, deletions `\deleted[id=RN]{}`, rewrites `\replaced[id=RN]{}{}` (changes package)
- Reviewer colors: R1 blue, R2 red, R3 orange, R4+ purple (`\definechangesauthor`)
- Every proposed reference validated via Scopus; `[NO DOI]` flagged in the summary when applicable

### Calling an agent explicitly

Agents are normally triggered automatically by context. To invoke one directly, address it
by name in your message:

```
Use the scopus-auditor agent to audit the review in paper_review/literature_review.tex
```

```
reviewer-response agent: --paper sn-article.tex --reviewers r1.txt --editor "Prof. Yin"
```

The slash commands `/auditreview`, `/replyreviewer`, `/litreview`, etc. are thin wrappers that
call these agents with the same argument syntax — use the commands for convenience and the
explicit agent names when you need finer control or want to chain agents in one message.
