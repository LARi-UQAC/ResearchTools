# Token Management

Chapter 03 of the ResearchTools manual. Back to [table of contents](../../README.md).

Use these tools together to keep sessions fast and cheap.

## Output modes

| Mode | Command | Max length | Formatting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Normal | *(none)* | Unlimited | Full — headers, tables, bullets |
| Concise | `/concis` | 5 sentences | Structured bullets allowed |
| Slim | `/slim` | 2 sentences | Code blocks only, no prose |

## Recommended workflow

1. **Start** every session with `/slim` (quick tasks) or `/concis` (exploratory work)
2. **Scope** context with `/focus <topic>` to avoid loading irrelevant files
3. **Monitor** with `/ctx` when responses feel slow — it reports context pressure in under 10 lines
4. **Compress** with `/compact` when `/ctx` reports moderate or high pressure

> `/compact` is destructive — conversation history is summarized and cannot be restored. Always run `/ctx` first to confirm it is needed.

## Quick reference

| Command | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| `/slim` | Fast edits, one-liners, quick questions |
| `/concis` | Code reviews, multi-step explanations |
| `/focus <topic>` | Long sessions touching many files |
| `/ctx` | When the session feels sluggish or heavy |
| `/compact` | After `/ctx` reports moderate/high pressure |
